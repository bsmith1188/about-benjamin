<head>This is about Benjamin.</head>
<title>Well let's try this again.</title>
<body>
	<p>So this one is going to be more or less boring, sorry. Long story shot my name is Benjamin Smith
	or Smtih if you ask the people who work at CNM. So I am experiencing what is called "Capital Punishment"
	for the first time. To add a cherry on top I also wasn't thinking when I made the new repository and completely
	destroyed all the progress I had made because only one thing at a time can be copied to the clipboard.
	TL:DR I'm a jackass but at the same time I enjoy the pain so much and am quite excited about the rest of this class.
	</p>
	<p>Aside from being a total moron at times I enjoy long walks on the beach... just kidding. In my free time
	I play a lot of games with my close friends and we are all actually quite competitive so it gets quite intense.
	I have taken courses on coding before but they were very shallow compared to deep dive, pun intended.
	Hopefully one day I can take what I learn here and wrap it into a career and eventually make my own company and
	eventually start trying to build my own game. The only experience that I am lacking is with the coding itself so
	hopefully this will give me everything I need in order to learn coding via physics engines and create my own game.
	</p>
	<p>Oh and by the way I'm going to attempt to make this a giant eyesore just because I wound up pissing myself off.
